Simple shopping cart system provides buy now buttons to purchase items via Paypal. Also links to Google Analytics to tracks sales. 

== Description ==

Add "Add to Cart" buttons to your pages / posts with sidebar widget showing items currently in customer's shopping cart. When customer clicks on 'Go to Checkout' 
then can purchase items via Paypal. Simple, secure shopping cart system stores no user information (email, address, credit card, etc) but uses
encrypted buy now buttons to pass customer over to Paypal for providing purchasing information. 

Features:

*   Easily add "Add to Cart" buttons to pages / posts
*   Secure, encrypted Buy Now buttons for Paypal and Google Wallet
*   You can include options to your products, with different prices if necessary
*   Easy to customize, including custom functions to get pricing (e.g. volume discounts), shipping options, etc
*   Optionally adds Google Analyics tracking code and links Paypal purchases with Google Analytics Ecommerce


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `scabn` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

You will find 'SCABN Settings' menu in your WordPress admin panel and the icon in your post editor panel.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 2.0 =
SCABN 2.0 (and 1.9.X) is a major rewrite of the SCABN. The template system in particular is totally different. This means that any template / customization from 1.X will have
to be rewritten to new system. Please make a backup of your template before upgrading and look at templates/default.php after upgrading for how to customize SCABN in new template system.

Also, some of SCABN's settings will get lost in the upgrade and have to be reentered. Please make sure you have those settings (Paypal Email, PDT number, etc) written down / backed up before upgrading.
 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I just installed the plugin. Now what? = 

1. Create a new page. Title something like 'Checkout'. In the page edit toolbar, click on the icon of a shopping cart with an 'S' (Add SCABN Item or Checkout). Check "Make this page my Checkout Page". Save the page and note its url.
2. Go to Appearance / Widgets and add the 'SCABN Checkout Cart' widget somewhere on your side. This is a mini shopping cart that will be displayed on all your pages.
3. Goto Plugins / SCABN Settings. Under 'Checkout/Process Page URL' put the url from step 1. Fill out other information such as Paypal Account, etc as desired.
4. Edit a page where you want an 'add to cart' item. Click on the icon of a shopping cart with an 'S' as in step one, but this time fill out the item name, cost, etc.
5. Done! View your page. When you click on the add to cart button, it should show up in the mini shopping cart widget. That widget will have a link to your checkout page. Your checkout page will then show you the full shopping cart and provide buy now buttons for Paypal and Google Wallet.
6. Optional: Read templates/default.php for example on how to customize SCABN. Copy default.php to yourtemplate.php and edit as desired. Enable this template (yourtemplate) via SCABN's setting page.

= How do I select shipping options? = 

Paypal doesn't support dynamic shipping optios, so log in to your Paypal account and goto Profile, More Options, My Selling Tools, Shipping Calculations and
you can define different shipping options for different locations and weight OR price of the order.

== Screenshots ==

1. Wordpress site using "Add to Cart" plugin on main page and a plugin on right sidebar showing current contents of the shopping cart.
2. Wordpress site of the final checkout page.
