Description: Simple Cart and BuyNow for Wordpress
Version: 2.1.4

/*
This plugin was once Wordpress-Checkout. Thanks to Alain Gonzalez for
that plugin -- I've forked it to remove features / complexity I don't
need and to add support for Google Wallet, signed carts, etc and support
newer versions of Wordpress as Wordpress-Checkout is no longer maintained.

Simple Cart & Buy Now (SCABN) is designed to implement a basic shopping
cart system and checkout system for wordpress e-commerce websites with two
principal goals:

1) No storing of user information
2) Security: encrypted 'buynow' buttons and pricing information not obtained
   from data provided by the user's browser.

Paypal BuyNow supported with encrypted BuyNow button.

Also has hooks support for giving customers custom shopping carts via url or uuid and
tracking visitors and customers with Google Analytics.

Template system for customize look of the shopping cart
and to use optional db backend or other phph functions to get
pricing, shipping, weight information, bulk discounts, etc
