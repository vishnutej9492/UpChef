== Frequently Asked Questions ==
<h4>Do I need to edit html or javascript?</h4>

There is no need to edit any line of code.

<h4>How do I eliminate/remove the plugin from certain page(s) or post(s)?</h4>

When editing a post or page, you can check the "E-MAILiT" option in "screen options" to enable E-MAILiT remove meta box.

<h4>How do I activate / de-activate your plugin?</h4>

Please, read the guide here http://wordpress.org/plugins/e-mailit/installation

<h4>How do I link the Facebook Like Button or the Tweet Button to my pages?</h4>

Facebook Like Button displays the likes about a specific url. In order to show correctly your likes you must place the button in the right place. If you haven't inserted the button in your home page, propably your likes are linked to it. If in case this is valid, by placing the button in your home page you will see the correct like counter for your site.

<h4>Facebook Share Button seems to show an incorrect number! Why?</h4>

The count result is common for share and like interactions. Please, see here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button/ There are counters for posting an article or sharing a page content. These are two seperate different interactions. But you can include the Share button next to the Like button, having more sharing options to display on your website and not feeling confused about the similar counters. You will have two different buttons together, with one counter only to display.
